# battleshipsProject
An application which will allow the user to play the board game battleships in the console.

The idea of this project was to provide a practical application of my python programming skills, by making a larger project involving a large amount of coding. The basic ideas were that I wanted to add as much reusable code as possible, with a clear use of methods, classes and objects inserted into the main program. I also tried to make the code tidy, using clearly marked separate files for the classes and methods, while the main program imports these. It was also important to me that there was no way for the user to incur any errors that would cause a crash, hence a thorough approach to handling different inputs to the console.

To run this program, download all files into a seperate folder and run main.py.
